develop a memory design and testbench

handshaking means--> when valid and ready both are high

write to the memory--> writing some data to the memory
read from the memory--> reading those particular data from the memory

where we can write or read data--> at memory location/address

we can to the transfer only when valid and ready pin are 1

memory is an array of vector--> reg [WIDTH-1:0]mem[DEPTH-1:0]
WIDTH--> the size of the data we are going to write or read so vector
DEPTH--> no of locations the memory has

reg [7:0]mem[10:0]--> this memory has 11 locations and each location can store 8 bit data

size of the memory is 88 bit

size of the memory = DEPTH * WIDTH
DEPTH = 2**ADDR_WIDTH

in sequential logic--> when reset is present, we make all the reg type variables as 0.

FSM--> Finite State Machine

we are going to deetect some pattern using finite state machines

FSM are of two types--> 1. Mealy state machine(depends on current state as well as inputs)
						2. Moore state machine(depends on current inputs only)


i want to implement a state machine which has 5 states --> Mealy will have 5 states
														Moore will have 1 more state i.e 6 states

non-overlapping--> when pattern gets detected, we will search from the next bit of the pattern
overlapping--> we will start searching the pattern whenever there is a possibility of getting the pattern


if B comes --> S_BBCBB
